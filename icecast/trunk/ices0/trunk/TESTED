Since the autoconf system has been largely rewritten I've removed all the
previously tested configurations. But it works on my systems:

Mac OS X 10.2.4/lame 3.93/python 2.3

If you've successfully built and run it on other systems, please send details
to me at <brendan@xiph.org>, and I'll update this list.
