* Improved error handling
* Make the scripting engines, and vorbis and MP3 reencoding, run-time linkable
* Investigate preventing chirps. These can happen if the previous file ended in
  the middle of a frame. Possibly padding out to the frame length with NULL would fix it.
  A really cheap hack would be to just dump the maximum possible frame size worth of
  NULLs into the stream. In practice, this might not be any different since the
  player should just ignore everything up until the next sync word.
