If you're installing ices from cvs, you need to do something
like this:

cvs co ices
cd ices
cvs co resolver thread
cd thread
cvs co avl
cd ..
cvs co libshout

./autogen.sh
make

And you'll hopefully have a ices binary in src/

For configfiles, ices depends on libxml, and I've
only tested it with libxml version 2.
Make sure you've got xml-config in your path and
that setup should be fine.

For playlist handlers, ices can optionally use
python (perl support is on the way).
Add --with-python to the configure script if you
want this enabled.

For reencoding, you'll need libmp3lame, and the --with-lame* options
in configure. That works fine for me most of the time, but I wouldn't
exactly call it stable.

Check the ./configure --help options for this.

Good luck :)
