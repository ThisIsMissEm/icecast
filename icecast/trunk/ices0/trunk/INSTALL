If you're installing ices from cvs, you need to do something
like this:

cvs co ices
cd ices
cvs co resolver thread
cd thread
cvs co avl
cd ..

./autogen.sh
make

And you'll hopefully have a ices binary in src/

ices now depends on libshout, and it will look
for ices.h in /usr/include/shout/shout.h and
/usr/local/include/shout/shout.h.
If you've got libshout installed somewhere else,
then you need to use the libshout parameters to
the configure script.

Same with libshout.a or so.

For configfiles, ices depends on libxml, and I've
only tested it with libxml version 2.
Make sure you've got xml-config in your path and
that setup should be fine.

For playlist handlers, ices can optionally use
python (perl support is on the way).
Add --with-python to the configure script if you
want this enabled.

Don't forget to run ldconfig after you've installed
libshout on elf systems.

For reencoding, you'll need libmp3lame, and the --with-lame* options
in configure. That works fine for me most of the time, but I wouldn't
exactly call it stable.


Check the ./configure --help options for this.

Good luck :)
