BUILDING FROM SOURCE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Do ./configure, optionally with --with-perl, --with-python and --with-lame, 
if you want support for that.

If for some reason the configure script doesn't find the include files for
python, perl or lame, you have to specify the path to these with
--with-something-includes and --with-something-libraries.

It's probably a good idea to do this anyway.

./configure --help will help you out with the exact syntax for those options.

To configure it all, I use
./configure --with-perl --with-python --with-lame --with-lame-includes=/home/eel/lame --with-lame-libraries=/home/eel/lame

My python is in /usr/include/python1.5, and perl in /usr/lib/perl/perl5/..., but the configure script
finds it there so I don't have to specify the path for those.

Then, do 'make' and everything should be fine.

Optionally do a 'make install' which installs all the ices stuff.

BUILDING FROM CVS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're installing ices from cvs, you need to do something
like this:

cvs co ices
cd ices
cvs co resolver thread avl log libshout

./autogen.sh
make

And you'll hopefully have a ices binary in src/

For configfiles, ices depends on libxml, and I've
only tested it with libxml version 2.
Make sure you've got xml-config in your path and
that setup should be fine.

For playlist handlers, ices can optionally use
python or perl.
Add --with-python or --with-perl, to the configure script if you
want this enabled.

For reencoding, you'll need libmp3lame, and the --with-lame* options
in configure. That works fine for me most of the time, but I wouldn't
exactly call it stable.

Check the ./configure --help options for this.

Good luck :)
