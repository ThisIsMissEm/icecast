1. What should the ices playlist file look like?
A: For the builtin playlist handler (the default), the playlist file
   is very simple. One file per line, and nothing else.
   E.g:
   /mp3/live/cool_live.mp3
   /mp3/cool/live_cool.mp3
   etc..

2. The icecast server tells me the password is wrong, but I have
   the correct password in my ices.conf file! What am I doing wrong?
A: Either ices can't find the config file, or you compiled ices without
   support for libxml (probably because your system does not have
   libxml). Without libxml, no config files.
   It could also mean that you compiled the icecast server with crypt
   support.

3. I want to write a perl or python playlist handler for ices, but
   I don't know where to start.
A: Have a look in the skeleton files ices.pm for perl and ices.py for
   python. That's a good place to start. Also read README.playlist.

4. Why don't you support embedded TCL?
A: Code it yourself if you like it so much. Check src/interpreter/interpreter.c
   for details. We support python and perl, so adding another language can't
   be that hard.

5. Reencoding, cool, hehe, cool, fire! Eeeh.. dammit, liblame, eeh.. where
   do I get it?
A: At the lame site at http://www.sulaco.org/mp3/

6. What about libxml?
A: At the libxml site at http://www.xmlsoft.org/

7. Will ices run on windows?
A: Yes, we're working on a port to win32.

8. When compiling ices with lame support, I get link errors on some
   termcap functions like tgetret(), what's wrong?
A: There are different ways to compile the libmp3lame.a file, and ices
   wants it to be clean of GTK and termcap stuff. So edit the
   lame Makefile and comment out the GTK, GTKLIBS, BRHIST_SWITCH and
   LIBTERMCAP lines for your target. Or, add -ltermcap and whatever
   other libraries are needed to the ices Makefile. 

9. Ices refuses to accept my configuration file, it says something about
   XML not accepting the namespace, what's wrong?
A: Simply put, you've got a too old version of libxml.
   Get a new one from http://www.xmlsoft.org/.
