Since the autoconf system has been largely rewritten I've removed all the
previously tested configurations. But it works on my systems:

Debian Sid
	Kernel 2.4.5-SMP on dual PIII
	glibc 2.2.3
	gcc 2.95.4
	perl 5.6.1
	python 2.0
	libxml 2.3.10
	lame 3.89alpha6
	     3.88beta
Solaris 8
	Generic_108528-06 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Blade-100
	gcc 2.95.2
	perl 5.6.1
	no python
	no libxml
	no lame

If you've successfully built and run it on other systems, please send details
to me at <brendan@kublai.com>, and I'll update this list.
