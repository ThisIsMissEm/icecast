Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
For a very long time, the only good streaming tool for command line systems
was shout. Shout had a lot of issues, it was a quick and dirty hack, it
was buggy, it was sending data too fast or too slow, and it was just something
no one wanted to fix.

So we rewrote it from scratch, and the next generation streamer, 'ices', is
here. 'ices' is short for 'icesource', a source for the icecast server.
'ices' should be pronounced 'isis' like the egyptian godess of fertility.

For more information about icecast, I suggest you check out the icecast
webpage at http://www.icecast.org/.

What is it for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ices, armed with a list of mp3 files, sends a continuous stream of mp3 data
to an icecast server. The server is then responsible for accepting client
connections and feeding the mp3 stream to them.
But the stream originates in the streamer, 'ices'.
The terms 'encoder', 'streamer' and 'source' are used equivalently throughout
this document, and throughout all the documentation in the streaming system.

What can it do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ices can do everything shout could do, and more.
It can be configured through hard coded defaults, a configfile, and command
line options.

The configfile is in XML, but don't get scared and run off. Just edit the
distributed configfile and change the values you need.

The command line options should be familiar to old shout users, although 
some options have been renamed.

Lets first go through the things you can change in ices.

* Server Hostname
	Command line option: -h <host>
	Config file tag: Server/Hostname
	This is the name, or ip, of the host ices should connect to.
	It has to run a streaming server, capable of the xaudiocast
	or icy protocol.
	This value defaults to localhost.

* Server Port
	Command line option: -p <port>
	Config file tag: Server/Port
	This is the port the server is listening on, by default 8000.

* Server Password
	Command line option: -P <password>
	Config file tag: Server/Password
	The encoder password for the server. If this is not correct,
	then ices cannot log in on the server, and ices will exit.

* Server Protocol
	Command line option: -i for icy-headers
	Config file tag: Server/Protocol
	Either xaudiocast or icy. Use xaudiocast if you can, and icy
	if you must.

* Execution Background
	Command line option: -B
	Config file tag: Execution/Background
	This will launch ices in the background, as a daemon.

* Execution Verbose
	Command line option: -v
	Config file tag: Execution/Verbose
	Normally ices outputs what stream is playing and a small
	amount of extra information.
	With verbose turned on, you get a whole lot of debugging
	information and lots of track info.

* Execution Base Directory
	Command line option: -D <directory>
	Config file tag: Execution/Base_directory
	ices uses this directory for cue files, log files and
	temporary playlist files. You need write permissions
	in this directory. The default is /tmp

* Execution Reencode
	Command line option: -R (turns reencoding on)
	Config file tag: Execution/Reencode
	When you turn this option on, ices (if compiled with libmp3lame support) will
	reencode your mp3 files on the fly to whatever bitrate you specify with the
	Stream Bitrate option.
	PLEASE note that if your files are corrupt, this might crash ices because the
	library used to decode (mpglib) is not very stable.
	I suggest you check your files with mp3check or some other mp3 verification program
	before you add them to your playlist.
	Just popping them into your favourite player and checking the sound is definately
	not enough.
	For legal reasons, this option is not available on the binary distributions.
	
* Stream Name
	Command line option: -n <stream name>
	Config file tag: Stream/Name
	This is the name of the stream, not to be confused with the
	name of the song playing.

* Stream Genre
	Command line option: -g <stream genre>
	Config file tag: Stream/Genre
	This is the genre of your stream, e.g Jazz or Static.

* Stream Description
	Command line option: -d <stream description>
	Config file tag: Stream/Description
	This option is a description of your stream.

* Stream URL
	Command line option: -u <URL>
	Config file tag: Stream/URL
	This should be a URL describing your stream.

* Stream Bitrate
	Command line option: -b <bitrate>
	Config file tag: Stream/Bitrate
	If you turn on reencoding then this will be the bitrate of the stream,
	otherwize the actual bitrate of the stream is the bitrate your files
	are encoded at, and this value is for displaying purposes only.
	Read the last 3 lines again, please.

* Stream Public
	Command line option: -s (makes stream private)
	Config file tag: Stream/Public
	This regulates whether the icecast server will display your stream
	on a directory server. Default is 1 (yes).

* Playlist File
	Command line option: -F <file>
	Config file tag: Playlist/File
	This is the file where ices originally looks for files to play.
	When using playlist modules in perl or python, this argument
	is passed to the playlist handler. Also see README.playlist.

* Playlist Randomize
	Command line option: -r (randomizes file)
	Config file tag: Playlist/Randomize
	This option is passed to the playlist handler, and tells it
	to randomize the playlist.

* Playlist Type
	Command line option: -S <perl|python|builtin>
	Config file tag: Playlist/Type
	By default, ices using a builtin playlist handler. It handles randomization and not
	much more. Most people want sophisticated playlist handlers that interface databases
	and keeps track of god knows what. ices handles embedded python and embedded perl,
	so now you can write your own modules, without modifying ices, that does just about
	anything. Use this option to change the playlist handler type from builtin (default),
	to python or perl. Also see README.playlist

* Playlist Module
	Command line option: -M <module>
	Config file tag: Playlist/Module
	Use this option to execute a different python or perl module than the default.
	Default for python is ices.py and default for perl is ices.pm.
	Do not add the file extension to this argument. I.e type "whatever"
	instead of "whatever.pm" or "whatever.py".
	Also see README.playlist.

How is it licensed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ices is licensed under the Gnu General Public License, and for more info about that
I suggest you read the file named COPYING.

Features
~~~~~~~~

---------
Cue file:
---------
The cue file holds information on the file that ices is currently feeding
to the server. This is neat for you people out there who like running scripts.
I myself, use the cue file in a tcl script, running from a eggdrop bot, on irc.
That way I can ask the bot what song is currently playing, how long it is, how
much of it has been played, and get information about the next songs on the
playlist.
The file currently has the following lines, (in this order).
* filename
* size (in bytes)
* bitrate (in kbits/s)
* minutes:seconds (total song length)
* percent played (i.e 25, no %-sign)
* playlist line index (i.e 3, if we're playing the 4:th line in the internal
  playlist. Logical, huh? ) Also, for you scripting people, when ices
  starts, it writes its process id to the file ices.pid.
* ID3 Artist 
* ID3 Title

Signals:
--------
Sending SIGINT to ices will make it exit.
Sending SIGHUP to ices will make it close and reopen the logfile.

----------
Reencoding
----------
If compiled with support for reencoding using liblame, and you supply the
-R command line option or set the Execution/Reencode to 1 in the XML config
file, then ices will start reencoding your files on the fly to the bitrate
you specified with the -b option or the Stream/Bitrate tag.
The sample rate, number of channels, etc, will be chosen on the fly by
lame itself, you have no control over this. If you want to change it, I suggest
you add support for this to ices and mail me a patch.
I think you should be fine with whatever lame chooses though.
Also, please make sure that your files are ok before you start reencoding them
with ices. This is because the mpglib part of lame (what does the decoding) is
rather unstable and will call exit(0) when errors are encountered. This will
make ices exit, which is kinda bad :)
I've only tested this with lame 3.86.1, and your mileage my vary.

-----------------
Playlist handlers
-----------------
About 96% of all emails I got about shout was people asking me to add small
changes to shout playlist handling to suit their specific needs.
This is course is not how I want to spend my life :)
Shout had a feature to call an external program with a system() call, before
each song, and that could possibly modify the playlist.
This was rather ugly, but did the trick.
In ices, we take this a step further an include scripting support inside the
program. You can write your own playlist handler in perl or python, whatever
you prefer.
Your script module has to define 5 functions; test, init, shutdown, get_next,
and get_current_lineno.
I suggest you take a look in the distributed module files and just expand on
that.
