. loss of audio sync on playlist USR1/USR2 is cause by the timer accounting for the
page granulepos but not all the packets are extracted and sent to icecast. 

. do the vorbis granulepos calculations in the playlist and send out packets instead
of pages.  The output is ok now for taking packets.

. playlist needs re-org to do packet sending and possible program spawn for external
decode like mp3 transcoding.  Use libcurl for direct ogg URL to packet
sending.

. pcm input needs to drop the silence detection logic, and also default to do no
sleeping as most uses are externally timed anyway.

. ALSA needs to be worked on to be usable

. make output mechanism more modular, so that multiple output can be done

  <shout>
     <hostname>....</hostname>
     <port>....</port>
  </shout>    

. make passthough work better, currently sends pages which are then split up.

. separate cfg parsing to individual modules, with the core left in cfgparser.c

considerations.

libcurl 7.10 needed for no signal support

getting the playlist to produce packets instead of pages will resolve the extended 
sleep check better and may resolve the lost samples on USR1/2.
