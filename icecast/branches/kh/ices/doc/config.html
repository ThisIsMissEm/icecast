   <h1>Config File</h1>
   <table width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#007B79" height="10" align="center"></td></tr></table>
   <p>The ices 2 configuration file is in XML format, which is described in detail below.
   There are a few sample XML files provided which show the main ways ices is used.<p>
   </p>
   A live audio feed often comes from a soundcard but may come via a server such as JACK
   <ul>
       <li>ices-oss.xml
       <li>ices-alsa.xml
       <li>ices-jack.xml
   </ul>
   <p>Other possibilities usually involve a playlist, but you may want to invoke a separate
   program which can produce PCM via a pipe into ices.</p>
   <ul>
       <li>ices-pcm.xml
       <li>ices-playlist.xml
   </ul>
   <p>The ices-switch.xml is an example of how you can define a series of inputs. You could
   use this to switch between a live session and a pre-recorded playlist if it require. All
   available inputs can be used with this mechanism, but only 1 can be used at any one time.
   A switch between inputs can occur if an input stops or manual intervention occurs with a
   USR2 signal.
   </p>
   <p>An unusual one is the ices-fixit.xml, which is basically a playlist but just outputs
   to files and the timer is disabled so that it runs very quickly. This can be used to
   split files or maybe even repair some Ogg Vorbis files.</p>

   <h2>General layout</h2>
   <pre>
    &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
    &lt;ices&gt;
        general settings
        stream section
    &lt;/ices&gt;
   </pre>
   <h2>General settings</h2>
   <p>These apply to IceS as a whole. The example below gives a useful example to work to</p>
    <pre>
     &lt;background&gt;0&lt;/background&gt;
     &lt;logpath&gt;/var/log/ices&lt;/logpath&gt;
     &lt;logfile&gt;ices.log&lt;/logfile&gt;
     &lt;logsize&gt;2048&lt;/logsize&gt;
     &lt;loglevel&gt;3&lt;/loglevel&gt;
     &lt;consolelog&gt;0&lt;/consolelog&gt;
     &lt;pidfile&gt;/var/log/ices/ices.pid&lt;/pidfile&gt;
    </pre>
    <h4>background</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     Set to 1 if you want IceS to put itself into the background.
    </div>
    <h4>logpath</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     A directory that can be written to by the user that IceS runs as.  This
     can be anywhere you want but as log files are created, write access to the
     stated must be given.
    </div>
    <h4>logfile</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     The name of the logfile created. On log re-opening the existing logfile is
     renamed to &lt;logfile&gt;.old. In the case of HUP, renaming is not done as
     it is often moved/deleted before the signal is sent.
    </div>
    <h4>logsize</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     When the log file reaches this size (in kilobytes) then the log file will
     be cycled (the default is 2Meg). Sending the HUP signal reopens the log
     which is another way for logs to be cycled.
    </div>
    <h4>loglevel</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     A number that represents the amount of logging performed.
     <ul>
      <li>1 - Only error messages are logged
      <li>2 - The above and warning messages are logged
      <li>3 - The above and information messages are logged
      <li>4 - The above and debug messages are logged
     </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>consolelog</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     A value of 1 will cause the log messages to appear on the console instead
     of the log files. Setting this to 1 is generally discouraged as logs are
     cycled and writing to screen can cause stalls in the application, which
     is a problem for timing critical applications.
    </div>
    <h4>pidfile</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     State a filename with path to be created at start time. This file will
     then contain a single number which represents the process id of the
     running IceS. This process id can then be used to signal the application
     of certain events.
    </div>
    <h2>Stream section</h2>
    <p>This describes how the input and outgoing streams are configured.<p>
    <pre>
     &lt;stream&gt;
         Global metadata
         Inputs
         Runners
     &lt;/stream&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3>Global metadata</h3>
    <pre>
         &lt;name&gt;My Stream&lt;/name&gt;
         &lt;genre&gt;Rock&lt;/genre&gt;
         &lt;description&gt;A short description of your stream&lt;/description&gt;
         &lt;url&gt;http://mysite.org&lt;/url&gt;
    </pre>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     This section describes what metadata information is passed in the headers
     at connection time to icecast.  This applies to each instance defined within
     the stream section but maybe overridden by a per-instance &lt;metadata&gt;
     section.
    </div>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <p>
     This section deals with getting the audio data into IceS. There are a few
     ways that can happen. Typically it's either from a playlist or via a soundcard.
    </p>
    <p>
     The layout is consistent between the different input modules. Within the
     input section a module tag is needed to identify the module in question. The
     rest are made up of param tags specific to the module. There can be several
     param tags supplied to a module.  Details of the module parameters are
     shown later.
    </p>
    <h3>Runners</h3>
    <p>A runner is a thread. You need at least 1, but each runner can process
    several encodings. As encoding is a CPU intensive task, grouping these
    into the same runner can help the load on the machine, especially if your
    machine does other work. Often only 1 runner is needed but you could say 
    that the general rule of thumb is 1 runner per CPU.
    </p>
    <p>While a runner may indicate the CPU usage, the actual encoding of the
    stream is placed within an &lt;instance&gt;.  More than 1 instance can be
    defined within each runner.
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;runner&gt;
            &lt;instance&gt;
            ...
            &lt;/instance&gt;

            &lt;instance&gt;
            ...
            &lt;/instance&gt;
        &lt;/runner&gt;
    </pre>
    <h3>Instance</h3>
    <p>
    Each instance defines 1 encoded stream. This means that for multiple
    bitrate/quality streams, a separate &lt;instance&gt; is needed for each
    bitrate.  Each instance defines a particular set actions that occur on the
    passed in audio. Any modifications to the input data are isolated to the
    instance.
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;instance&gt;
            name
            description
            genre
            url
            resample
            downmix
            encode
            savefile
            shout
        &lt;/instance&gt;
    </pre>
    <h4>name, description, genre and url</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
    These are exactly the same as the ones defined in the global metadata.
    In here they override the global settings, so often these are not needed
    </div>

    <h4>Resample</h4>
    <pre>
        &lt;resample&gt;
            &lt;out-rate&gt;22050&lt;/out-rate&gt;
        &lt;/resample&gt;
    </pre>
    <div class=indentedbox>
    This is used to force the samples coming from the input to be at a specific
    samplerate, this can be useful if the input can be varied or if the input can only
    do 1 samplerate like 48000 and you want to stream at 22050. Reducing the samplerate
    is one way to reduce the stream bitrate but you lose higher frequency sound.
    <p>
     The most common values used are 48000, 44100, 22050 and 11025, and is
     really only used to resample to a lower samplerate, going to a higher rate
     serves no purpose within IceS.
    </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Downmix</h4>
    <pre>
        &lt;downmix&gt;1&lt;/downmix&gt;
    </pre>
    <div class=indentedbox>
    Some streams want to reduce the bitrate further, reducing the number of channels
    used to just 1. Converting stereo to mono is fairly common and when this is set
    to 1 the number of channels encoded is just 1. Like resample, this only affects
    the one instance it's enabled in.
   </div>
   <h4>Encode</h4>
   <pre>
    &lt;encode&gt;  
        &lt;quality&gt;0&lt;/quality&gt;
        &lt;nominal-bitrate&gt;65536&lt;/nominal-bitrate&gt;
        &lt;maximum-bitrate&gt;131072&lt;/maximum-bitrate&gt;
        &lt;minimum-bitrate&gt;-1&lt;/minimum-bitrate&gt;
        &lt;managed&gt;0&lt;/managed&gt;
        &lt;passthru&gt;0&lt;/passthru&gt;
    &lt;/encode&gt;
   </pre>
   <p>quality</p>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State a quality measure for the encoder. The range goes from -1 to 10 where -1
    is the lowest bitrate selection (default 3), and decimals can also be stated, so
    for example 1.5 is valid.  The actual bitrate used will depend on the tuning in
    the vorbis libs, the samplerate, channels and the audio to encode. A quality of 0
    at 44100hz and 2 channels is typically around the 64kbps mark.
   </div>
   <p>nominal-bitrate</p>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State a bitrate that the encoder should try to keep to. This can be used as an
    alternative to selecting quality. 
   </div>
   <p>managed</p>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State 1 to enable full bitrate management in the encoder. This is used with
    nominal-bitrate, maximum-bitrate and minimum-bitrate to produce a stream with
    more strict bitrate requirements. Enabling this currently leads to higher CPU
    usage.
   </div>
   <p>maximum-bitrate</p>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State bitrate in bits per second to limit max bandwidth used on a stream. Only
    applies if managed is enabled.
   </div>
   <p>minimum-bitrate</p>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State bitrate in bits per second to limit minimum bandwidth used on a stream.
    Only applies if managed is enabled, this option has very little use so
    shouldn't really be needed.
    </div>
    <p>passthru</p>
    <div class=indentedbox>
    Set to 1 if you want incoming pre-recoded vorbis (from playlist) to not 
    be re-encoded. This should only really be used if you have a PCM input
    that needs encoding but a playlist that does not.
    </div>

    <h4>Savefile</h4>
    <pre>
        &lt;savefile&gt;
            &lt;filename&gt;/archive/ices/%F/stream.ogg&lt;/filename&gt;
            &lt;duration&gt;86400&lt;/duration&gt;
            &lt;fmask&gt;0644&lt;fmask&gt;
            &lt;dmask&gt;0755&lt;dmask&gt;
            &lt;on-metadata&gt;1&lt;/on-metadata&gt;
        &lt;/savefile&gt;
    </pre>
    Sometimes the stream transmitted wants to be saved to disk. This can be useful
    for live recordings.
    <p>filename</p>
    <div class=indentedbox>
        State a filename for saving the Ogg Vorbis data. Files can be re-opened so
        you probably want to state a pattern like as shown that allows for expanding
        at the time it is opened. The % codes can be found in strftime(2) and can
        apply to directories as well as files.
    </div>

    <p>duration</p>
    <div class=indentedbox>
        After the stated number of seconds, the current save file is closed and then
        another is automatically re-opened based upon the filename pattern.
    </div>

    <p>on-metadata</p>
    <div class=indentedbox>
        Like above this determines when the save file is closed and the next reopens,
        in this case new headers (new metadata) triggers the reopening.
    </div>

    <p>fmask</p>
    <div class=indentedbox>
        When a new file is created, it is given the stated mask so that permission
        access is maintained.
    </div>

    <p>dmask</p>
    <div class=indentedbox>
        It is possible that new directories could be created (if the pattern uses a
        % code for a directory component), if so, then this states the directory
        mask.
    </div>

    <h4>Shout</h4>
    <p>This is used to define a connection to an icecast server. Several &lt;shout&gt;
    definitions can be used if you want to state different servers for the same
    encoded stream.  Each shout connection acts independantly from each other but they
    send the same encoded stream</p>

    <pre>
        &lt;shout&gt;
            &lt;hostname&gt;streamingserver.org&lt;/hostname&gt;
            &lt;port&gt;8000&lt;port&gt;
            &lt;password&gt;hackme&lt;password&gt;
            &lt;mount&gt;/stream.ogg&lt;mount&gt;
            &lt;yp&gt;1&lt;yp&gt;
            &lt;flush-samples&gt;20000&lt;flush-samples&gt;
            &lt;reconnectdelay&gt;60&lt;reconnectdelay&gt;
        &lt;/shout&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>hostname</p>
    <div class=indentedbox>
        State the hostname of the icecast to contact, this can be a name or IP
        address and can be ipv4 or ipv6 on systems that support IPv6. The default
        is localhost.
    </div>
    <p>port</p>
    <div class=indentedbox>
        State the port to connect to, this will be the port icecast is listening on,
        typically 8000 but can be any.
    </div>
    <h4>password</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
        For providing a stream, a username/password has to be provided, and must
        match what icecast expects.
    </div>
    <h4>mount</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
        Mountpoints are used to identify a particular stream on a icecast server,
        they must begin with / and for the sake of certain listening clients should
        end with the .ogg extension.
    </div>
    <h4>yp</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
        By default streams will not be advertised on a YP server unless this is set,
        and only then if the icecast if configured to talk to YP servers.
    </div>
    <h4>flush-samples</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
        This is the trigger level in samples for when ogg pages are sent out. The
        default is the samplerate which means some data is sent each second.
    </div>
    <h4>reconnectdelay</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
        This is the number of seconds, after a disconnect, that will be left to pass
        before another connection is attempted.
    </div>
