Feature differences from SVN trunk

. server xml reload, and reopen logging available via admin url
. When max-listeners reached, a HTTP 302 code can be sent to redirect
  clients to alternative slave hosts. 
. authenticated relays, those that match the relay user/pass, bypass the 
  max-listener check
. mount can filter out theora content, useful for define a local relay of a
  theora+vorbis stream to have a vorbis only stream from the same source.
. multiple shoutcast source clients possible.
. a per-mount charset can be defined, translates to UTF8.
. stream-auth option for url authenticator.


2.3-kh6
. implement <limit-rate> bps in <mount>, the bitrate which triggers a timer for
  possible source termination, also causes a slow down in reading. default no
  limit applied.
. implement <avg-bitrate-duration>, calculate average bitrate of over so many
  seconds (default 60)
. add <wait-time> to indicate how long a mountpoint is reserved for after a
  source client terminates.
. some internal cleanups
. stats value cleanups.
. hardcoded AAC content type missing
. initial xml setting bug, caused crash with later glibc.
. streamlist.txt should list inactive mounts if their hidden fallback is active.
. move listener_connection increases even later so that listeners on failed
  on-demand relays don't get counted.
. updates to charset handler, for failure cases
. kh5a included a fix for a segv that crept in.

2.3-kh5
. add media-type to xsl pages, IE has trouble with xhtml
. add <accesslog-exclude-ext> for defining extensions that do not get reported
  via the web interface (they are still written in the log file). Whether
  alternative tags should be used is still undertermined.
. fix for empty log display via xsl, produced odd chars.
. auth url avoids calling backend code when settings are not defined.
. content type fixes for xslt files
. allow <shoutcast-mount> to appear in <listen-socket>, this defines a per-port
  based mountpoint allowing multiple shoutcast source clients to connect. This
  also defines a port+1 listen-socket automatically.
. xml parsing changed, 'yes' and 'true' can be taken for boolean settings. some
  removal of deprecated tags but may of missed a tag so report if any are.
. added <filter-theora> boolean for <mount>, filters theora out of passed stream
  so listener only gets what is left.
. add per-mount listener_connections stat
. add <allow-url-ogg-metadata> bool per-mount, enable to allow url based metadata
  updates. Default disabled.
. add charset option to mount options. It allows for conversion to UTF8
  for the stats/web pages and therefore YP listings and playlist log.
. minor changes to web pages.
. allow for 403 response from auth url to pass back to listener, in the case of
  a 200 response from auth server, allow 403 at start of message to indicate a
  403 response to listener.

2.3-kh4
. fserve thread now looks for a chain of refbufs as well.
. plug leaks from coverity code analysis. mainly minor but a possible fd leak.
. log handles caching of N lines.
. show last N lines of log contents via admin pages
. change webpages (for the better!), add logs display and reload config.
. use 64bit handling when using stats _add calls
. send 403 not 404 for max listeners reached.
. add server-wide total sent in streams count. 
. fix possible corruption case with new cients.
. on listener move, search from burst point if most recent refbuf is not a sync
  point, currently only theora streams.

2.3-kh3
. add source auth via authenticator, affects certain admin access as well.
  Only url auth using it currently
. relays now have start timestamps, prevents a possible constant rescanning
  effect with multiple relay failure case
. fix memory leak in ogg flac case.
. update YP, get bitrate from stats (incoming_bitrate), if not provided. Issue
  yp add after 60 secs, gives time for bitrates to settle.
. cleanups in auth setup, push more setup code into the core auth handler.
. when moving listeners, if most recent refbuf is not a sync point then use
  burst point. Fallback theora streams can be affected by this.
. drop master-redirect-port, use <port>.
. set <master-redirect> (in slave) non-zero to send IP/port details in
  streamlist request, so that new listener redirection from master is possible.
. set <max-redirect-slaves> (in master) to specify the number of slave servers
  that can request listener redirection, default 0.
. prevent avg/total byte stats for fallback to file sources.
. allow for server id to be defined in xml.
. add connected stat to source, duration in seconds.
. increase average stats for bitrate calculation to 30 seconds
. increase sleep duration in connection thread to 100ms
. make source clients report read bytes in access.log
. bypass clients limit check for ssl connections, let admin do stuff
. various type cleanups, gcc4 show various signed/unsigned issues.
. sync up with trunk, win32, os.h/compat.h, minor type definitions

2.3-kh2
. merges from post 2.3 release/feedback
  - stats speedup, from order O(n^2) to O(1)
  - log cycle update. can state log size and whether renaming with date extension
    is to be done
  - fixup grnaulepos handling in vorbis rebuild. minor audio playback glitch
  - sync intro file change over HUP handling.
  - send 403 responses instead of 404 in certain cases.
. added realm and drop_existing_listener settings to generic auth.
. auth url didn't handle authetication of the invoked scripts. Now the order
  we handle auth is
  - url as   http://user:pass@.../
  - take auth from options username and password
  - if listener_add/remove then use username/password from listener
. fix double free bug in auth

2.3-kh1
. fix double buffer release when dropping auth'd listeners on source exit
. don't put client on auth engine if removeurl is not set
. update xsl pages.

. added logsize tag, for automatic move/reopen of logs
. fix race on new listener connection
. missed lock when relay allocates a client
. nul char out by 1 position in initial connection buffer (request)
. slow down accept thread if client limit reached
. cleaned up access logging, username is logged if present

  - win32 free bug, unix doesn't seem affected
  - htpasswd segv bug when auth file is missing
  - auth.xsl fixup
  - mp3 metadata cleanup

2.2-kh16
. fixed segv when using oddcast DSP
. master/slave streamlist is now isolated in its own thread, so should not
  affect the slave thread which among other things does timer updates. libcurl
  is used so that is required but you can do ssl queries if required
. new listeners will be rejected if auth queue is backed up
. Changes to web pages by Dave St John
. isolated SSL/non-SSL switch to connection_t
. An older xslt lib can be used (earliest version has not been determined yet)

  drop in connection thread.
. send the fixed string responses via fserve, unlikely to show as a problem
  for normal connections but required for SSL sockets.
. Added SSL handling on certain ports define with <ssl>, initial work by
  oddsock, extended due to connection handler changes.
. merge small changes from trunk to keep things in sync
. increased the max number of listen sockets to 50

2.2-kh14
. various auth updates. The auth thread main code handling updated.
  - auth url, various checks added for missing settings, listener timelimit
  added. Added port to POST and useragent (icecast version). 
  - auth_htpasswd, uses avl tree to store users, faster compared to disk 
  and mtime is used to make sure it's in sync.
. win32 updates, probably more cleanups needed but file references are correct
  again.
. some small memory leaks plugged and typos fixed.
. added the favicon.ico file from the website

2.2-kh13
. updates the m4 scripts, pthread for solaris/gcc and check for --with-X
. the ogg reading code could busy loop in certain cases, fixed
. limit ogg codecs per stream to 10 so that it has some upper bound and not a
  potential excessive memory taker.
. always on relays missed out the listener count initially, fixed
. compiler cleanps.
. YP sends server client limit if max_listeners is set, however client_limit
  is not in the stats tree, should it be?
. oddcast sends stream data with http headers, which caused the non-blocking
  connection thread to drop the inital bit of the stream, ie ogg header.
. fix xslt handling properly, buffer truncation was missing and empty string
  was leaving the socket open.
. fixup handling for shoutcast source clients that send a \n for EOL
. only log to access log if a response code is set

2.2-kh12
. rework connection handler to work on non-blocking sockets. the listener thread
  handles the http reading, after which it passes it over to the connection
  thread for parsing.
. any xsl file can be placed in admin now and can work off the stats data
. dump listener details to xml for admin requests that get the stats tree
. make sure that fallback file streams are hidden
. fix fd leak in error case for file ranges and plaintext list_mounts function
  like that used for querying a master server
. use correct offset from burst point for new clients
. batch up small reads for passthrough streams into slightly larger blocks, so
  that TCP protocol overhead is kept to a minimum.
. because of the batching, the max send count per client per iteration is less
. fixup streamlist.txt to be sent via fserve thread
. fixup automatic m3u output to be via fserve thread.
. XML read from HUP is not sent via the connection handler now, instead the
  slave thread processes it
. doc update for url listener auth

2.2-kh11
. xsl/xml pages from adminroot and webroot are now delivered via the file
  serve thread.
. Allow TouchFreq changes for actions other than add
. update main auth handler, don't require user:pass to be passed, leave it to
  the specific auth to decide.
. update auth_url, pass original request url through to auth in mount=
. plug some small memory leaks in auth engine
. remove some dead code

2.2-kh10
. play better with Real/Helix, StreamTitle needs to be sent at least initially.
. A zero'ing of the listener count occured affecting on-demand relays. A left
  over from the pending queue drop
. various small checks added
. trunk sync-up

2.2-kh9
. drop the pending list for each source, adds clients to active list directly
. intro and fallback to file handling fixed again, recent changes caused
  certain aspects to not work.
. helix/real player wants StreamTitle metadata at the start or else it messes
  up the mp3 playback.
. small stats/xsl updates

2.2-kh8
. fix moving listeners bug recently introduced, affects fallback mounts
. make YP engine, url escape alls stats before sending to YP server.
. make <no-yp> setting work again, but it is being deprecated because of the
  newer <public> setting
. add slow_listeners stat. A count of listeners that fall too far behind
. small doc updates

2.2-kh7
. fix busy poll loop, introduced in kh6, fast clients are now placed at the
  end of the listeners lists and the starting position is recorded. 
. use a loop when checking the burst point, that way reducing burst size over
  HUP works on active streams
. fix 64bit usage in access.log on win32
. Add ability for relays to be switched on or off but still reserve the
  mountpoint.
  - Added <enable> tag to <relay>, takes a 1 (default) or 0
  - change with url /admin/managerelay?relay=/localmount&enable=1

. 404 unknown requests
. removed dead/duplicated code
. check for non-regular file in fserve

2.2-kh4
. Added FLAC/MIDI to Ogg Handler
. sources count was left increased if client limit was reached
. A failed on-demand relay left new-listener count increased
. streamlist.txt is now built from mount list, not source list as source
  clients could disappear but may have a mount with a fallback specified.
. update auth_url with some pointer checks, added server= to the post
  information sent in 'add'
. missed <subtype> in previous update
. a bad request from client caused a clients count leak

2.2-kh3
. fix nasty buffer reference bug which could cause excessive queue usage
  when using chained theora streams
. fix to server full message, client count handling is now done by the 
  client_create/destroy. client_t created in main handler and passed down
. YP update. The add retrieves the stats not the create, allowing for a
  delay in setting the stats. fixes 'blank server name' error. on-demand
  relays can now add to YP before connection.
. slave thread now checks if shutdown is required after the sleep
. dropped parser/con from source_t
. a few NULL pointer fixes from auth change and some small mem leaks fixed
. don't trigger short delay in fallback file thread

2.2-kh2
. optional url requests for source startup/shutdown.
. 'header' option for listener url auth.  If this header is returned 
  for the auth request then the listener is authenticated.
. per-mount override for <stream-name> <stream-description> <stream-url>
  <genre> and <bitrate>
. fixes to previous auth update

2.2-kh1

  with connection
  - auth_t part of mount_proxy now
  - xsl/m3u/fserve handling occurs after auth
  - single auth thread used (can be part of a pool)
  - listeners are auth'd on the mountpoint they requested, no matter if 
    a fallback was triggered.
. fix bug introduced in kh6 when url updates are used with vorbis only streams
. source stats for on-demand relays could disappear when they should not
. after intro file has been sent, the listener is placed on stream queue to
  complete the stated burst size

  not, automatically determined now (drop the ogg-rebuild option)
. more error checking in theora handling
. unused code removal
. merge from trunk
  - add cluster-password
  - admin page for updating title via url


2.1-kh3
. merge of the 2 ogg modules
  - drop --enable-vorbis-upodates, use <ogg-rebuild> in the <mount> instead

  - make format_mp3 the default handler, passing through the mime type, that
    way unknown streams like AAC, NSV just pass through
  - fixup for naming and authenticating of shoutcast mountpoint
  - docs and win32 build setup

2.1-kh2

. add server client_limit and source_limit to stats
. filter duplicate metadata in inline mp3 streams 
. minor fix the xslt
. minor leak on failed range header fserve client
. added AAC and AAC+ content-types for mp3 handler
. resync with trunk
    logging metadata, needs testing
    added <shoutcast-mount> for shoucast DSP compatible clients

2.1-kh1
. Added <intro> tag to <mount> to allow the contents of a nominated file
  (in the same format as the stream) to be sent to a listener before the actual
  stream is.  On-demand relays also work with this.
. fallback-mount can now be used to state a file not just another streaming
  mountpoint (needs to be same format as the stream), fallback-override works
  with this.
. the stats.xsl page lists all stats, status.xsl does not show hidden ones.
. internal cleanups when processing clients. Drop the use of per-client predata
  and use usual buffers instead. more even client write distribution.
. resync with work from 2.1 release and trunk
    shoutcast style source client, needs verifying
    NSV streaming.
    Win32 build cleanups

kh58
. fix stability bug on vorbis rewrite module (--enable-vorbis-updates)
. fixes to URL metadata handling. For vorbis streams they didn't update
  the stats/YP, for MP3 they were ignored if the source stream had no metadata
. fixed small leak in slave host handling
. resync with various trunk changes (aliasing cleanups, win32 timezone offset,
  log messages, docs, xsl files etc)
. for auth_url ignore case for authentication header
. updates to slave handling of stats when relays start/stop, mainly relating
  to on-demand relays
. expand on the trigger for determining if a relay has changed, it was only
  on local mountpoint before.
. if an on-demand relay shuts down, don't remove the YP info

kh57
. don't list hidden mounts on streamlist.txt
. fixup format_vorbis from singleq merge, memory leaks and uninitialised
  pointers.
. for YP, grab the ice-bitrate from stats at the time of adding to server,
  this is useful as YP spec has bitrate as mandatory but bitrate may only
  be determined from stream.
. check per-mount auth settings for per-mount admin requests, useful on
  url metadata updates
. resync web and admin docs with recent xhtml work in trunk

kh56
. provide an alternate sock_write_fmt for old style vsnprintf, this was
  causing no data (on truncation) to be sent on windows (stats.xml).
. restructure stats engine, the inc/dec calls could cause incorrect values
  due to racing with unprocessed events. The maths is done in the engine now
. due to the stats engine, various changes to stats for mountpoints have
  happened, most/all cases look ok. stats relays will need double checking
. added max_listeners stat to each listed mount.
. added icecast version global stat
. fixed bug when a on-demand relay as a fallback was being started when
  it should not of been.
. allow for clients to fallback from on-demand relays that fail to start
. The default mp3 interval is now 16000 bytes (inline with trunk) but this
  can be overridden per-mount with <mp3-metadata-interval> in bytes. Other
  format-specific settings could be possible.
. update fserve thread to check which clients are writable, CPU loading
  could become high if slow and fast clients are connected.

kh55
. let the stats relays loop around instead of blocking on conditions, that
  way we don't get out of sync if we miss a wakeup.
. some NULL checks in stats code were missing.
. updated xsl transform code, small changes to status.xsl as well
. add checks for missing / starting mountpoints
. sync up YP in trunk, this looks to be solid now.
. small include cleanups

kh54
. NULL dereference in yp from previous patch now fixed.
. When override set on an on-demand relay, then the relay now checks to see
  if there are any listeners on the fallback mount, if so then it starts up.
. removed useless per source clients stat, listeners already exists

kh53
. remove the last remaining stats at stream shutdown.
. implement hidden attribute for stats, source stats can be toggled between
  hidden/visible. This is a slight change to stats usage but not major.
. mountpoints on xsl are better handled now
. drop slave-host from xml parsing. They are used internally, created and
  removed by master relays authenticating against the relay user/pass.
. when moving clients don't report on-demand relays as source not available
. when moving clients don't show move clients on mount /a to /a entry.
. race fix for YP entries

kh52
. A lot of resync work with trunk
. add queue shrinking, reduces queues to either last listener or burst
. minor race fix, mp3 url update lock.
. allow for xsl files to show inactive mounts but with active fallbacks
. Add <hidden> attribute to <mount> to prevent xsl display
. add <burst-on-connect> flag to maintain compatability with trunk
. doc updates

kh51
. make config lock a rwlock instead of mutex, removes unneccesary stalling
  and removes possible (although not reported) deadlock cases
. very hard to trigger race in util fixed
. on-demand authenticated relay wasn't being kicked off properly
. allow the prevention of duplicate authenticated clients connecting. The
  mechanism is the same as SVN except duplication checking is a generic
  authentication check and applies to all auth mechanisms.
. make connection handler only sleep when connections are not pending
. mp3 streams with in-line metadata could of created some empty nodes, not
a stability problem, but wasteful.
. small memory leak fixes
. small internal code cleanups

kh50
. removed redundant pointer, adding new clients could cause a memory
  corruption problem
. structured relay startup differently, so that relays operate independently
  from one another. relay threads are now attached.
. resync with trunk. make m3u lookups more general, makes static files work
  with .m3u
. encode names and values from stats when building xsl pages
. add /admin/function[.xsl]?perform=xx the current handlers are
    xx = reopenlog
    xx = updatecfg
. removed old abort test

kh49
. allow for changes in mount settings to update active sources
. allow for slaves to authenticate with the master using the 
  master user/pass.

. mp3 fixes, url metadata related
. resync yp timeout code to the same as in trunk
. allow for redirecting new clients to other hosts when full

kh47
. per mount burst size was not being referred to properly
. added sync markers to queue for client starts, the buffer with a sync mark
  from the burst point is where a client starts from.
. theora marks a sync marker on a page which has the start of a keyframe.
. vorbis and speex mark sync on all buffers unless theora is used. mp3 sync
  marks on every buffer.
. some code re-org for queue management, allows old refbuf removal even
  on socket read timeout
. place clients that can take more pending data at the beginning of the client
  queue. This allows for reducing client scanning when there's a short timeout

kh46
. New listeners actually drop to fallback mount, silly inverse bug
. typo in mp3 metadata handling, affected error case, rare
. make short delay timeout work when reading from source, minor handling
  case from previous update.
. make the ogg vorbis module use 1000 not 1024 as a factor for stats.
. if a YP server is up but not responding with an error message then show
  a default one.
. fixed a fallback problem and improved the log messages for when fallback
  is triggered.

kh45
. fix minor YP cleanup case when YP server fails and source disconnects
. cleanup from previous patch exposed a potential source reading bug, which
  had shown up because sources could disconnect for no reason.

kh44
. fix segv case for non-auth streams, unchecked in last release.
. only send ICY 200 OK if realplayer else send HTTP/1.0 200 OK
. allow for setting username/password for auth URLs
. still apply timeout to recoverable source read

kh43
. add <username> <password> tags for <relay>, default none, both need to
  be provided for auth to be attempted.
. add url based auth module. example in conf, you can state add and
  remove urls to run for each client, each add is passed id, user, pass, ip,
  user agent. The remove is passed id, user, pass, duration
. make sure the global client count is in sync when auth is used

kh42
. drop the use of thread conditional variables in the connection threads,
  they we not working as they should
. minor cleanups, log messages etc
. re-work auth subsystem to allow for slow auth mechanisms
. added command auth, do that listener auth can be done externally. The
  external command should take a mount, user and pass on separate lines and
  return a status code of 0 (authenticated) or non-zero (reject)

kh41
. fixed 401 reporting on missing urls, should be 404. Handle a very rare
  long lock held case as well

kh40
. make sure public is 0 in the stats tree
. move parse_audio_info back to source.c and make it thread safe
. add debug for YP ok case, debug is supposed to be rarely used after all
. up the per-listener max write threshold
. report 401 for failed auth connections
. add audio/x-mpeg mime type

kh39
. mp3 streams without metadata were not having their metadata initialised
  properly, causing problems when clients connected with metadata capable
  clients.
. send ice-audio-info to clients, provides YP info in relays situations

kh38
. re-sync with svn codebase, update listener auth and docs
. send ICY OK instead of HTTP OK for realplayer test
. minor cleanups

kh37
. add the previous vorbis specific handler back in, it allowed for updates
  via url. enabled via configure --enable-vorbis-updates
. updated admin pages to those in the main tree
. plug some minor memory leaks in yp

kh36
. force yp_remove, log message when found, fixed a race as well
. fix mp3 segv when on-demand relays are used
. fix debug messaging in yp.c, helps to track any YP related problems
. emit icy-br instead of icy-bitrate, allow relays to be on YP listings, but
  handle icy-bitrate as well
. <no-yp> (default 0) in <mount> prevents a mount from going on YP listings
. fixes to ice-audio-info handling.
. make yp thread wait longer than it does at shutdown, allows for final
  yp_remove on closing streams

kh35
. handle YP error conditions better.
. moving clients via url allows on-demand relays to startup/shutdown
. segv bug fixed from previous release, http headers were being prepared
  on mount switchover.

kh34
. minor fixes for YP, fix missing bits from rewrite
  if any YP request fails go back to add
  do a yp touch on inline mp3 updates as well as url metadata updates 
. sync with main tree for minor patches.
. set default stream burst size to 64k (typical player prebuffer size)

. changed code on list processing for active and pending clients
. changed when format-specific client data gets freed up
. shuffle code around, OK response to source client only source_client_thread
. 404 sent to client on failed on-demand relay
. more re-sync work + various non-functional cleanups

kh29
. revert test harness code left from before which advertised private streams
  and cleanup unwanted messages

    Support listening on multiple sockets.

2003-03-08
    Support for shoutcast source protocol added.

2003-03-08
    Started implementing generic admin interface. Supports (so far): 
    - dynamic configuration of mount fallbacks
        /admin/fallbacks?mount=/mount&fallback=/fallback
    - setting of mp3 metadata
        /admin/metadata?mount=/mount&mode=updinfo&song=New%20Title
    - dumping raw xml stats
        /admin/rawstats
    - listing all connected clients on a mountpoint: 
        /admin/listclients?mount=/mountname

2003-03-05
    Implemented the ability to reread the config file on SIGHUP. For now, this
    does not affect configuration for currently running sources (only new
    sources and global parameters like max-listeners)

2003-03-02 
    More features:	 
    -- per mountpoint listener maxima   
    -- static configuration of mountpoint fallbacks   
    -- stream dumping (write incoming stream to disk)

2003-02-27
    Fix log buffering on win32 - previously, logs were never flushed, so they
    only got output every few tens or hundreds of lines.

2003-02-27
	Support new icy-audio-info header, to communicate various parameters to
    clients and yp servers, including sample rate, quality, channels, bitrate

2003-02-25
    Full support for relaying mp3 metadata (if turned on in config file)

2003-02-25
    Allow configuration of maximum client queue length (in bytes)

2003-02-14
    Finished full IPv6 support. 

2003-02-12
	Allow configuring local mountpoint seperately from remote mountpoint for
    relays

2003-02-12
	Per mountpoint usernames and passwords (for sources)

2003-02-11
	Now that it's been officially assigned, use application/ogg instead of
	application/x-ogg

2003-02-07
    Allow relaying of mp3 streams from icecast 1.x and shoutcast

2003-02-07
    Added ability to configure individual relays (rather than just all streams
    from a single server).

2003-02-03
    Added support for YP directory services listings
	are only used by the yp listing routines

2003-02-03
    Support command line parameter -b to run in the background (not supported
    on win32)

2002-12-31 
    Implement configurable mountpoint fallbacks (on source exit, clients are
    transferred to another mountpoint automatically, without disconnecting
    them)

2002-12-31
    Implemented full mp3 metadata support.

(older stuff is missing from here)
